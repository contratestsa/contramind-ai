Fix navigation between features and connect Analytics page to the chat interface:

1. FIX SIDEBAR NAVIGATION:
Update the sidebar to properly navigate between all features:

Sidebar items should be:
- Dashboard (home icon) → Goes to welcome screen
- New Contract (+ icon) → Opens chat for new upload
- Analytics (chart icon) → Goes to analytics page
- Contracts (folder icon) → Shows contract list
- Settings (gear icon) → Goes to settings
- Help (? icon) → Goes to help page

Fix navigation by ensuring each item has proper routing:
- Remove any conflicting navigation code
- Each menu item should have unique route
- Active state should highlight current page
- Clicking should not break layout

2. CONNECT ANALYTICS TO CHAT DATA:

A. Track Chat Interactions:
When user asks questions in chat:
- Store question type (liability, payment, termination, etc.)
- Link to contract being discussed
- Count frequency of topics

B. Update Analytics Based on Chat:
Add new section "Most Discussed Topics":
- Pull from chat history
- Show bar chart of question categories
- Update in real-time

C. Contract-Specific Analytics:
When viewing a contract in chat:
- Track view count
- Record time spent
- Note which sections discussed most

3. CREATE UNIFIED DATA FLOW:

Data flow should be:
Upload Contract → Chat Analysis → Store Results → Update Analytics

Store this data structure:
{
  contractId: "xxx",
  fileName: "contract.pdf",
  uploadDate: timestamp,
  riskScore: 45,
  findings: [...],
  chatHistory: [
    {
      question: "What about liability?",
      timestamp: date,
      topic: "liability"
    }
  ],
  viewCount: 5,
  lastViewed: timestamp
}

4. FIX NAVIGATION FLOW:

Dashboard → Click "New Contract" → Chat opens
Chat → Upload contract → Analysis runs → Results in chat
Sidebar → Click "Analytics" → See aggregated data
Sidebar → Click contract name → Resume that chat

5. PROPER STATE MANAGEMENT:
- Current page state
- Selected contract
- Chat history
- User session

Ensure clicking between pages maintains state.

6. FIX COMMON NAVIGATION ISSUES:

- Sidebar should stay consistent
- Don't reload entire page on navigation
- Maintain user context
- Show loading states during transitions
- Handle back button properly

7. TEST NAVIGATION FLOW:
Verify these paths work:
1. Upload contract → See in analytics
2. Chat about contract → Topics appear in analytics
3. Click contract in sidebar → Resume chat
4. Navigate to analytics → See real data
5. Go to settings → Return to previous page

Example navigation fix:
```javascript
// Sidebar navigation handler
const handleNavigation = (page) => {
  // Don't reload sidebar
  setActivePage(page);
  
  // Route to correct component
  switch(page) {
    case 'dashboard':
      showDashboard();
      break;
    case 'analytics':
      showAnalytics();
      loadUserContractData();
      break;
    case 'chat':
      showChat();
      break;
  }
  
  // Update URL without reload
  history.pushState({}, '', `/${page}`);
};

// Connect chat to analytics
const trackChatInteraction = (question, contractId, topic) => {
  // Save to database
  await saveChatMetrics({
    contractId,
    question,
    topic,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
  
  // Update analytics in real-time
  updateAnalyticsData();
};
