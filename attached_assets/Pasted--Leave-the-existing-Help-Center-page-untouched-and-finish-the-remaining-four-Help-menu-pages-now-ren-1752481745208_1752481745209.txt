Leave the existing Help Center page untouched and finish the remaining four Help-menu pages—now renamed to Desktop App, plus Release Notes, Terms & Policies, and Keyboard Shortcuts.

1. Help Center
* Hero header: “How can we help?” plus a universal search field.
* Category grid: four tiles (“Getting Started”, “Managing Contracts”, “Billing & Subscriptions”, “Troubleshooting”). Each tile opens a stub article list.
* Popular articles list: a vertical list of the top five FAQs.
2Release Notes
* Page title: “What’s New”.
* Vertical timeline: five sample version entries (tag, date, three-bullet highlights).
* Filter bar: All / Web / Desktop / Mobile.
* Call-out card at top: “Latest Release” badge that jumps to newest entry.
3 Terms & Policies
* Sticky left-side mini TOC with anchors: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy.
* Long-form document body separated by H2 headings; use placeholder copy.
* Optional acceptance banner (“By continuing, you agree…”) that can be toggled on for sign-up flow.
4 Desktop App (renamed from Download Apps)
* Intro blurb: “Install ContraMind on your desktop for a faster, native experience.”
* Platform cards (side-by-side):
    1. macOS – “Download .dmg” button.
    2. Windows – “Download .exe” button.
* QR codes under each card for quick download links.
* “Coming to Linux soon” teaser section.
* System-requirements list at bottom.


Shared guidelines
* Routing & breadcrumbs – Each new page gets its own clean URL (e.g. /desktop-app) and breadcrumb trail (“Help › Desktop App”).
* Styling & rhythm – Match existing typography, color tokens, and 16 px vertical spacing.
* Loading states & placeholders – Use skeleton loaders and “Coming soon” copy where real content isn’t ready.
Reminder: do not modify the Help Center page—save it as is and focus only on the four pages above.

Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth implementation process. We'll use Framer Motion for animations, maintain the existing ContraMind color scheme (#0C2836, #B7DEE8), and ensure all components are bilingual.
