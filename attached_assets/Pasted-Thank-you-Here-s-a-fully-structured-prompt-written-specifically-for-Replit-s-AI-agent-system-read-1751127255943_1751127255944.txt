Thank you! Here’s a fully structured prompt written specifically for Replit’s AI agent system — ready to be pasted into Replit’s “agent instructions” field or into a task chat:

🧠 Replit Agent Prompt: Fix ContraMind Website (English/Arabic UI + Navigation)

You are the developer assistant working on the ContraMind bilingual web platform. Your goal is to fix major usability, layout, navigation, and branding issues across English and Arabic views. The application is a SaaS platform with login and signup forms, a landing page, and dual-language support. The current version has several broken behaviors and visual inconsistencies.

⸻

✅ Your Responsibilities

1. Global Language-Aware Routing
	•	When users are on ContraMind.ai/en, any navigation (Login, Sign Up) must route to the English versions (/en/login, /en/signup).
	•	Likewise, ContraMind.ai/ar must route to Arabic versions (/ar/login, /ar/signup).
	•	Language context should persist when navigating between pages.
	•	Avoid hardcoded language fallbacks — use dynamic routing or i18n-aware router (e.g. Next.js i18n or Vue i18n).

2. Header + Logo Consistency
	•	Logo on Login/Sign Up is too small and not consistent with the homepage.
	•	Implement a persistent site header:
	•	Logo on the left (responsive)
	•	Language switcher top-right
	•	This header should appear on all pages — homepage, login, signup, contact.

3. Layout + Responsiveness
	•	Forms (login, signup) are too narrow on desktop. They appear mobile-styled in a desktop browser.
	•	Expand form container width to 480–600px on screens wider than 768px.
	•	Ensure full layout responsiveness (desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints).

4. Form Field Styling
	•	Replace dark field backgrounds with light gray (#F1F3F5 or similar).
	•	Placeholder text should be in muted gray (#9CA3AF).
	•	Add visible :focus styles for accessibility.
	•	All inputs must support LTR and RTL rendering.

5. Social Login Buttons
	•	Icons are incorrect:
	•	Google sign-in uses a Chrome icon (wrong)
	•	Microsoft sign-in uses a Google “G” (wrong)
	•	Replace with correct brand icons:
	•	Google → multicolored “G”
	•	Microsoft → official logo
	•	Also: Buttons have no functionality.
	•	Integrate working auth actions (can mock it, or use placeholder for now).

6. Language Switching
	•	Language toggling is unreliable.
	•	If a user is on /en and clicks Login, it should stay in English.
	•	If on /ar and clicks Login, it should stay in Arabic.
	•	Switching language should preserve the route context (e.g., /en/signup ↔ /ar/signup).

📌 Additional Fix (Based on User Feedback)

“Also, I’m not sure if you recall this, but when I open the main website in English and navigate to the login or sign-up pages, it should take me to the English version of those pages. Currently, it redirects to the Arabic versions instead. Likewise, if I’m on the English login or sign-up page, it does not consistently take me to the correct English destination.

This needs to be fixed. The website should have distinct routes:
	•	English: ContraMind.ai/en
	•	Arabic: ContraMind.ai/ar

From there, sign-in and sign-up should match the selected language.”

Implement full route separation with matching content localization.

⸻

🧪 Testing

Before you’re done, test the following:
	•	Desktop layout and spacing
	•	Form field styling in both languages
	•	Logo/header consistency
	•	Navigation in both language paths
	•	Language switcher behavior
	•	Social buttons with mock click events or real OAuth

⸻

✅ Final output should be clean, responsive, localized, and aligned with brand guidelines.
