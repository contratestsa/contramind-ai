Phase 2 of 2: Customer Journey & Onboarding Enhancements

With the critical issues fixed, these enhancements focus on making the user's first experience positive, intuitive, and engaging.
4. Implement a "First-Time User" Onboarding Flow
* Problem: New users log in to the dashboard with no direction, potentially leading to confusion and abandonment.
* Solution: Guide new users to their "aha!" moment with a simple onboarding sequence.
* Implementation Ideas:
    1. Welcome Modal: Display a one-time welcome message upon the user's first login to the dashboard.
    2. "Getting Started" Checklist: Implement a simple, dismissible UI element with 2-3 key steps to get started (e.g., "1. Create Your First Contract," "2. Invite a Team Member"). This gives users immediate, actionable goals.
    3. (Optional) Product Tour: Consider integrating a lightweight library like Driver.js to provide an optional, step-by-step tour of the main dashboard features.
5. Integrate an In-App User Feedback Mechanism
* Problem: Customers have no easy way to report bugs or suggest improvements from within the platform.
* Solution: Add a simple, non-intrusive way for users to communicate with us.
* Implementation Ideas:
    1. Feedback Button: Add a "Feedback" or "Help" button in a fixed position (e.g., bottom-right corner).
    2. Simple Form: On click, this button should open a simple modal with a text area and a submit button.
    3. Action: The submitted feedback can be configured to automatically create an email, send a message to a Slack channel via webhook, or log an issue in a project management tool.
6. Refine UI with Modern Loading States
* Problem: The UI likely shows a blank page or a generic spinner while data is being fetched for the dashboard, which feels slow and dated.
* Solution: Improve the perceived performance and user experience with modern loading patterns.
* Implementation:
    1. Skeleton Screens: Replace jarring loading spinners on the dashboard with skeleton loaders. These are placeholders that mimic the layout of the page, making the user feel like content is loading faster.


Testing Checklist & Quality Assurance

Authentication & Security:
* [ ] Test sign-up with Gmail, Outlook, and other business email domains.
* [ ] Confirm all verification/password-reset links use the contramind.ai domain.
* [ ] Test expired token and link scenarios.
* [ ] Attempt to access /user-dashboard directly without logging in (should redirect to /login).
* [ ] Verify that logging out properly invalidates the session.
Onboarding & UX:
* [ ] Confirm the Welcome Modal appears only once for new users.
* [ ] Test the "Getting Started" checklist functionality (checking items, dismissing it).
* [ ] Verify the feedback widget successfully sends messages.
* [ ] Check that skeleton loaders appear correctly on the dashboard during data fetch.
