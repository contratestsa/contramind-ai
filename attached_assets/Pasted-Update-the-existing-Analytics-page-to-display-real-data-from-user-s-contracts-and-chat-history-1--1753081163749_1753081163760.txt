Update the existing Analytics page to display real data from user's contracts and chat history:

1. DATA COLLECTION:
Replace fake data with real data by:

- Get all contracts for current user from Firestore/database
- Filter by user ID to show only their contracts
- Calculate metrics from their actual data

2. UPDATE KEY METRICS CARDS:

Total Contracts:
- Count: Get length of user's contracts array
- Instead of: "705" → Show actual count

Average Risk Score:
- Calculate: Sum all risk scores / number of analyzed contracts
- Show real average (0-100)

High Risk Contracts:
- Count contracts where riskScore > 70
- Update number dynamically

Contracts This Month:
- Filter contracts by uploadDate in current month
- Show real count

3. UPDATE PIE CHARTS:

Contract Type Distribution:
- Group user's contracts by type
- Calculate percentages from actual data
- Update chart with real distribution

Risk Distribution:
- Count contracts in each range:
  * Low: riskScore 0-33
  * Medium: riskScore 34-66
  * High: riskScore 67-100
- Show actual percentages

Language Distribution:
- Track which language was used for analysis
- Show EN vs AR percentage from real data

4. UPDATE BAR CHARTS:

Top Risk Categories:
- Parse all analysis results
- Count occurrences of each risk type:
  * Liability issues
  * Payment terms
  * Termination clauses
  * IP rights
- Sort by frequency and display

Monthly Trend:
- Group contracts by upload month
- Show last 6 months of real data
- Update automatically as new contracts uploaded

5. CONNECT TO CHAT DATA:
- Track questions asked in chat
- Show most discussed topics
- Link chat queries to specific contracts

6. REAL-TIME UPDATES:
- Refresh data when new contract uploaded
- Update after each analysis completes
- Recalculate when contracts deleted

7. EMPTY STATES:
If user has no contracts:
- Show friendly message: "Upload your first contract to see analytics"
- Display sample charts with blur effect
- Prompt to upload contract

Example code structure:
```javascript
// Fetch user's contracts
const contracts = await getUserContracts(currentUser.id);

// Calculate metrics
const totalContracts = contracts.length;
const avgRiskScore = contracts.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.riskScore, 0) / contracts.length;
const highRiskCount = contracts.filter(c => c.riskScore > 70).length;

// Update chart data
const contractTypes = groupBy(contracts, 'contractType');
const typeDistribution = Object.entries(contractTypes).map(([type, items]) => ({
  name: type,
  value: items.length,
  percentage: (items.length / totalContracts) * 100
}));
