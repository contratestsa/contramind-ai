Replace the current empty Analytics page with a full dashboard containing charts and visualizations:

1. ANALYTICS PAGE STRUCTURE:
Keep the current sidebar but update main content area:

Header Section:
- Title: "Analytics & Reports" (already there)
- Add date filter dropdown: "Last 30 days" (top right)
- Export button next to date filter

2. KEY METRICS ROW (below header):
Create 4 metric cards in a row:

Card 1: Total Contracts
- Large number: "0" (will update with real data)
- Label: "Total Contracts"
- Small change indicator: "+0% from last month"

Card 2: Average Risk Score  
- Large number: "0"
- Label: "Average Risk"
- Color indicator based on score

Card 3: Active Contracts
- Large number: "0"
- Label: "Active Contracts"

Card 4: Compliance Rate
- Large number: "0%"
- Label: "Compliance Rate"

Style: White cards with slight shadow

3. CHARTS SECTION (2x2 grid):

Top Left - Contract Type Distribution (Pie Chart):
- Title: "Contract Types"
- Segments: Services, Licensing, NDA, Sales, Other
- Show percentages on hover
- Legend on right

Top Right - Risk Distribution (Donut Chart):
- Title: "Risk Levels"
- Three segments: Low (green), Medium (yellow), High (red)
- Center number shows total

Bottom Left - Monthly Trend (Line Chart):
- Title: "Contract Volume Trend"
- X-axis: Last 6 months
- Y-axis: Number of contracts
- Line with points

Bottom Right - Top Issues (Horizontal Bar Chart):
- Title: "Common Risk Areas"
- Bars for: Liability, Payment Terms, Termination, IP Rights
- Show count for each

4. RECENT ACTIVITY TABLE (below charts):
- Title: "Recent Contract Analysis"
- Columns: Contract Name, Date, Risk Score, Status, Action
- 5 rows of sample data
- Pagination at bottom

5. MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL:
When "Upload Contract" button is clicked:
- Navigate to chat interface
- Start new contract upload flow

Connect to real data:
- When contracts are analyzed, update all numbers
- Charts should reflect actual user data
- Empty state only shows when truly no data

6. USE CHART LIBRARY:
Use Chart.js or Recharts for visualizations:
- Responsive charts
- Smooth animations
- Interactive tooltips
- ContraMind color scheme

7. SAMPLE DATA STRUCTURE:
For now, use this mock data structure:
```javascript
const analyticsData = {
  totalContracts: 0,
  avgRiskScore: 0,
  contractTypes: {
    services: 0,
    licensing: 0,
    nda: 0,
    sales: 0
  },
  riskDistribution: {
    low: 0,
    medium: 0,
    high: 0
  },
  monthlyTrend: [
    { month: 'Aug', count: 0 },
    { month: 'Sep', count: 0 },
    { month: 'Oct', count: 0 }
  ],
  commonIssues: {
    liability: 0,
    paymentTerms: 0,
    termination: 0,
    ipRights: 0
  }
};
