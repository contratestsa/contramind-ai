Perfect! I see exactly what you want to replicate. Let me revise Phase 1 to include this starting point and be more specific:

## Phase 1: Basic Electron Setup (Revised)

**Prompt 1 to Replit:**
```markdown
Create a basic Electron app structure for ContraMind, similar to Canvas Desktop app.

STARTING POINT: We already have a desktop download page (see reference) that shows:
- Download buttons for macOS and Windows
- Version numbers (2.1.0)
- File sizes (89 MB for Mac, 95 MB for Windows)
- System requirements displayed
- "Linux support coming soon" message

YOUR TASK:
1. Create /desktop folder in the existing ContraMind project
2. Set up desktop/main.js with:
   ```javascript
   // Basic window config matching our brand
   const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
     width: 1400,
     height: 900,
     minWidth: 1024,
     minHeight: 768,
     backgroundColor: '#0C2836', // ContraMind navy
     webPreferences: {
       preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
       nodeIntegration: false,
       contextIsolation: true
     }
   });
   ```
3. For now, load the existing web app:
   - In dev: http://localhost:3000
   - In prod: file://index.html
4. Create empty preload.js file
5. Update package.json with:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "electron:dev": "electron desktop/main.js",
     "electron:build": "electron-builder"
   },
   "devDependencies": {
     "electron": "^27.0.0",
     "electron-builder": "^24.0.0"
   }
   ```
6. Prevent multiple instances running

DO NOT add authentication, splash screens, or other features yet. Just get the basic Electron window running with our React app inside.

The goal is to create the desktop app that users will download from our download page.
```

**Additional Context Image to Share with Replit:**
Share the Canvas desktop page screenshot and add:
```
"This is what our download page looks like. We need to build the actual desktop app that users will download when they click these buttons. Start with basic Electron setup."
```

This approach:
- ✅ Gives Replit clear context about what you're building
- ✅ References the existing UI they can see
- ✅ Prevents hallucination by being very specific
- ✅ Focuses only on core Electron setup

After Replit completes this, share:
1. Screenshot of Electron window running
2. The file structure created
3. Any errors encountered

Then we'll move to Phase 2 with confidence that the foundation is solid.
