Right now the “Sarah / Profile” card plus Settings, Help, Log out (and other account-level links) sit at the very bottom of the left sidebar. I want them to behave exactly like they do in ChatGPT: a small circular avatar in the top-right corner of the app that, when clicked, opens a floating dropdown with those options.
Layout & behaviour to implement
1.     Remove the profile block from the sidebar.
2.     Add an avatar button in the global top bar, aligned flush right (same row as any existing “Share” or menu icons). Use the user’s initials or uploaded photo; default to a gray icon if none.
3.     When that avatar is clicked, show a dropdown panel that matches ChatGPT’s: • White background, subtle 12 px corner radius, soft shadow. • Width ≈ 280 px; vertically auto-sizes to content. • Menu items stacked with 16 px padding-Y, 20 px left padding; each row has a left-aligned icon + label. • Exact item order: (email header, non-clickable) → Add teammates → Workspace settings → Customize App → Settings → divider → Help → Log out.
4.     Anchor & positioning • Absolutely position the dropdown so its top aligns just under the avatar button and its right edge aligns with the avatar’s right edge. • Close the dropdown on outside click or Esc key.
5.     Accessibility & UX • Avatar button has aria-haspopup="menu" and aria-expanded state toggling. • Keyboard navigation: Up/Down arrows cycle items; Enter/Space activates. • Dropdown traps focus while open and returns focus to avatar on close.
Styling  Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth implementation process. We'll use Framer Motion for animations, maintain the existing ContraMind color scheme (#0C2836, #B7DEE8), and ensure all components are bilingual.
Deliverables • Updated JSX/HTML for global header with avatar button. • Dropdown component (headless or using your existing UI library). • CSS/Tailwind classes or SCSS variables that apply the above styles. • Event handlers for open/close and keyboard support. • Removal of old sidebar profile markup.
