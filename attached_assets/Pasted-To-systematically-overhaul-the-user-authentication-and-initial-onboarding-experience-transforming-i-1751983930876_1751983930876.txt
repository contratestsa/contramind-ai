To systematically overhaul the user authentication and initial onboarding experience, transforming it from a functional but disjointed process into a seamless, professional, and trustworthy journey that builds customer confidence and accelerates user activation.


Phase 1 of 2: Critical Fixes & Professional Polish

These tasks address urgent issues that undermine the platform's credibility and security.
1. Unify All Email Communications Under the Official Domain
* Current Problem: All automated emails (verification, password resets, etc.) send links with a replit.dev domain. This looks like a development environment, eroding the trust of our B2B clientele.
* Required Solution: All user-facing links in all emails must originate from the contramind.ai domain.
* Implementation Steps:
    1. DNS Configuration: Configure the contramind.ai domain (e.g., creating a subdomain like app.contramind.ai or similar) to point correctly to the Replit application.
    2. Environment Update: Update all environment variables and application code to use https://contramind.ai (or the chosen subdomain) as the base URL for generating all links.
    3. Template Audit: Systematically review and update every email template (verification, password reset, invite user, etc.) to use the new production URL.
    4. SSL: Ensure SSL is properly configured for the custom domain to maintain security.
2. Secure and Rename the User Dashboard
* Current Problem: The primary post-login destination is /coming-soon, a non-descriptive URL that is also publicly accessible, posing a significant security risk.
* Required Solution: The dashboard must be renamed and be accessible only to authenticated users.
* Implementation Steps:
    1. Rename Route: Change the page route from /coming-soon to /user-dashboard while preserving its exact content and design.
    2. Implement Auth Middleware: Protect the /user-dashboard route and any other sensitive routes. This middleware must check for a valid, non-expired session token (e.g., JWT) on every request.
    3. Redirect Unauthorized Users: If a user without a valid session attempts to access the dashboard, they must be immediately redirected to the /login page.
3. Standardize Email Verification for All Sign-Up Methods
* Current Problem: Users signing up with social providers (Google/Microsoft) bypass the email verification step, creating an inconsistent and incomplete registration process.
* Required Solution: Every user, regardless of sign-up method, must have a verified email address.
* Implementation Steps:
    1. Modify Auth Flow: Integrate the email verification step into the registration flow for Google and Microsoft OAuth.
    2. User State: Upon first social login, the user's account should be marked as "pending verification." They should be prompted to check their email to complete the process.
    3. Restrict Access (Optional but Recommended): Consider limiting access to certain features until the user's email is verified to encourage completion.
