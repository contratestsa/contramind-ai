🎯  GOAL: PARALLEL EXTRACTION + DASHBOARD ANALYTICS SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------------
• DO NOT change, replace, or affect any existing chat,
  chatbar, party-role logic, sidebar, or contract view.
• The chat system must work exactly as now (streaming,
  chat-to-contract, popups, saving, etc).

• Add a completely SEPARATE “analytics system” to the dashboard.

========================================================
🛠  DASHBOARD ANALYTICS REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Remove all existing dashboard charts and widgets.
2. Add exactly THREE new vertical column charts:
   – Chart 1: Contract Type (counts by type: NDA, MSA, Service Agreement, etc.)
   – Chart 2: Risk Rate (counts by extracted risk: High, Medium, Low)
   – Chart 3: Payment Liability (total/sum, by extracted payment field)
3. The charts must update automatically using data extracted from
   EVERY contract that the user has uploaded and started a chat with.

4. Build a **standalone atomic extraction pipeline** (can use
   pdf.js, mammoth.js, or similar) that runs as a side-effect of
   contract upload, extracting:
   – Parties
   – Type
   – Risk rating
   – Payment info
   – Any other fields you want to use for charts

5. Store all extracted analytics data in a separate state object
   (analyticsStore or similar)—do NOT mix with chat/conversation state.

6. If extraction fails for a contract, skip it in the charts (do not block).

========================================================
✅  DONE CHECKLIST
--------------------------------------------------------
☐ Main chat system works **exactly as before**, no changes.
☐ Dashboard only shows three live column charts (no pie, no static).
☐ Charts use only real extracted data from uploaded contracts.
☐ Extraction and chart logic is totally separate from chat logic.
☐ No console errors. No change in dark/light mode or layout.
☐ Log **DASHBOARD ANALYTICS READY** in console when complete.
