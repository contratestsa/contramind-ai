Build out the four sidebar pages 

Leave all existing screens intact and create full, first-pass pages for the four sidebar modules:
1. Analytics & Reports
2. Parties & Contacts
3. Notifications
4. Tags & Categories
Each new page must inherit the same scrollable-column shell used in the chat view, respect ContraMind colors , the 16-px vertical rhythm, Framer Motion 150 ms fades/slides, and bilingual RTL/LTR behaviour.

1 Pages you must CREATE now
1. Analytics & Reports - /analytics
2. Parties & Contacts - /parties
3. Notifications - /notifications
4. Tags & Categories - /tags
No other pages are needed at this stage.

2 Minimum content for each page
2.1 Analytics & Reports
Section name	What to show (sample / placeholder data is fine)
KPI ribbon	5 cards: Cycle-time, % On-time renewals, Active obligations, Average risk score, Savings captured
Trend charts	3 charts:• Line = cycle-time by contract type• Bar = amendments per quarter• Heat-map = risk level vs counter-party
Renewal radar	3 tiles: 90 days, 60 days, 30 days until expiry, each with a “Renew / Renegotiate / Terminate” button
Clause deviation	Table with top-10 negotiated clauses and % deviation from template
Export & schedule	Buttons: Download PDF, Download Excel, plus a toggle “Email weekly digest”
2.2 Parties & Contacts
Section	Content
Search + filters	By name, FEIN/DUNS, country, vendor type, internal owner
Counter-party profile	Org info, W-9/W-8BEN status, sanctions result, link to master agreement
Contacts list	Cards with role, phone, email, LinkedIn, “Primary signatory” switch
Engagement timeline	Chronological list of all contracts & amendments with this party
Risk panel	Litigation check status, last OFAC screen date, insurance expiry
Bulk actions	Buttons: Send NDA, Request COI, Link to CRM
2.3 Notifications
Buckets you must show:
1. Action required – approvals, signatures, drafts ready (sticky, with countdown timer)
2. Upcoming deadlines – renewals, obligations, audits (sorted by date, auto-escalate at 24 h)
3. System alerts – integration failures, permission changes (collapsible, “Mute 7 days” option)
4. Preference centre – toggles for Email, In-app, Slack, Mobile push

2.4 Tags & Categories
Required tools:
* Tree-view taxonomy builder (parent → child)
* Bulk manager (add, merge, retire tags; show “Used N times”)
* Governance rules (role-based edit rights, mandatory tags per contract type)
* AI auto-suggest tag button (placeholder)
* Small table that shows tag counts (feeds Analytics later)

3 Design & behaviour rules (apply to every page)


1. Bilingual: verify every item flips correctly between English (LTR) and Arabic (RTL).


4 Deliverables
* Four new page components with the exact sections above, filled with obvious placeholder data or “Coming soon”.
* Routes and breadcrumbs added.
* No console errors, and RTL/LTR toggle works on every new element.



Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth implementation process. We'll use Framer Motion for animations, maintain the existing ContraMind color scheme (#0C2836, #B7DEE8), and ensure all components are bilingual.
