* Lock the existing Help Center page. Do not change its hero, FAQ list, or footer.
* Build only these three Help-menu pages:
    1. Desktop App
    2. Release Notes
    3. Terms & Policies
* Remove every trace of “Keyboard Shortcuts” from menus, routes, and code.
1 Bilingual / RTL–LTR Requirements – non-negotiable
* Every new component must render identically in Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR).
    * Grids, paddings, icon placement, breadcrumbs, and animation directions must flip correctly when RTL is active.
    * Use the existing language-toggle hook; verify each page in both directions before marking complete.
* Framer Motion slide-in/out must originate from the logical edge (left in LTR, right in RTL).
* Apply the approved Arabic font stack; keep line-height equal to English.
2 Design System Constraints
* Colours: primary #0C2836, accent #B7DEE8.
* 16 px vertical rhythm on all spacing.
* Page-enter and hover transitions = 150 ms fade/slide via Framer Motion.
* Provide skeleton loaders or “Coming soon” placeholders where real content isn’t ready.
* All interactive elements keyboard-navigable and aria-labelled in both languages.
