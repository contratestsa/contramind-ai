The Arabic UI must place the chat controls block (input bar + quick prompts) in exactly the same visual position as the English UI:
* Before chat begins: perfectly centred in the middle of the remaining horizontal space (between the right edge of the sidebar—whatever its width—and the browser’s right edge) and vertically centred in the viewport.
* After chat starts: locked 32 px above the bottom of the viewport, still centred horizontally inside that available span. This behaviour must hold regardless of whether the sidebar is expanded or collapsed.

Requirements
1. Reuse the same positioning logic you added for English.
    * The wrapper that holds the chat controls already responds to a variable representing the sidebar’s width. Just ensure the Arabic layout reads that same variable so centring math is identical in both languages.
    * Keep the two vertical states: pre-chat (centred) and active chat (bottom-offset).
2. Right-to-left (RTL) does not affect horizontal centring.
    * Maintain dir="rtl" for Arabic text direction inside the controls, but the wrapper’s absolute/fixed geometry is language-agnostic.
    * Icons and text flip order inside the wrapper, yet the whole block must stay visually centred.
3. Sidebar toggle consistency.
    * When the sidebar changes width, update the shared width variable once and allow the wrapper to re-centre automatically—same as English. No hard-coded Arabic offsets.
4. Padding / scroll safety.
    * Ensure the scrollable messages area in Arabic has the same bottom padding (bar height + 32 px) so the last bubble never hides behind the bar.
5. QA checks before sign-off.
    * Arabic UI, sidebar open → chat controls centred; sidebar collapsed → still centred.
    * Send a first message → controls snap to 32 px above bottom; sidebar toggles → controls remain centred.
    * Test both desktop breakpoints used by the English design.

Deliverables
* Updated positioning logic applied to the Arabic locale.
* Confirmation that the wrapper respects the shared sidebar-width variable and behaves identically in LTR and RTL.
* Bottom-padding adjustment verified in Arabic conversation view.
