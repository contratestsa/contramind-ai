Then add mock AI response after 2 seconds:

Example:
User: "What is a limitation of liability clause?"
AI: "A limitation of liability clause is a contractual provision that caps the amount one party has to pay the other in case of breach or damages. In technology contracts, this often limits liability to the fees paid under the contract. It's important to review these carefully as they can significantly impact your risk exposure."
