🛠 Implementation Requirements
Theme Variables

Define CSS custom properties (or Tailwind theme extensions) for all key tokens:

css
Copy
Edit
--color-bg, --color-bg-secondary,
--color-text-primary, --color-text-secondary,
--color-accent
Provide light/dark fallbacks for each variable.

Automatic & Manual Switching

Default to the user’s OS color-scheme (prefers-color-scheme).

Add a theme-toggle switch in the header, next to the EN/AR toggle, to override default. Remember to persist the choice (e.g. localStorage).

Component Styling

Update every dashboard component (sidebar, header, chat pane, prompt cards, Help pages, modals, form inputs, buttons) to consume the new CSS variables or Tailwind classes (bg-[color-var], text-[color-var], border-[color-var]).

Ensure hover, focus, and active states use the accent color on both themes.

Dark-mode Adjustments

In dark mode, lighten shadows, soften borders, and ensure enough contrast (WCAG AA) for text against dark backgrounds.

For surfaces (cards, lists), use the secondary background variable.

No Homepage Impact

Confine all theme imports and style changes to the dashboard components. Do not alter homepage styles or global layout.

Testing & Accessibility

Verify every screen under /dashboard in both themes for visual consistency and text-legibility.

Keyboard-navigable theme toggle with proper aria-label.

Automated dark/light visual regression snapshots for core views.

✅ Deliverables
A ThemeProvider setup (or equivalent) that injects CSS variables based on prefers-color-scheme and toggle.

Updated styles (CSS/Tailwind config) for all dashboard components to use the new tokens.

A Header theme-toggle button beside the language switch.

Confirmation that only dashboard files changed; homepage remains untouched.

Success = seamless, brand-aligned light/dark experience across the entire dashboard.
